# Create ancestral fasta file
As stated [here](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Error_estimation)
> If you work with human data mapped to hg19 we have a fasta file containing the ancestral states (actually the chimp mapped to hg19). 
1) map donkey on horse reference (or chimp on human). 
2) /angsd -doFasta
