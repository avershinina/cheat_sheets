### Going from draft to the final version
Draft one:      
* Correct all spelling and grammatical issues.
Draft two:       
* Check that all references are complete.
Draft three:    
* Verify that all quotations are accurate.
Draft four:      
* Read the introduction. Does it explain the trajectory of the paper?  
Draft five:      
* Read the conclusion. Is there an efficient and evocative ending to the assignment?  
Draft six:        
* Check the first sentence (the topic sentence) of each paragraph. Does it convey the content of the paragraph that follows it?  
Draft seven:  
* Check the last sentence of each paragraph. Does it create a transition to the next paragraph?  
Draft eight:    
* Read each word and sentence for meaning and clarity. Is each word required? When in doubt – chop it out.  
Draft nine:     
* Ensure that there is cohesion between sections of the argument.  
Draft ten:       
* Do you answer the question? Return to the question and the marking criteria. Are you addressing all the required elements in the assignment? What mark would you give the paper?

### How to take notes
 1. Take notes from readings separate from the books and articles. Do not write ‘notes’ on photocopies or the books themselves. Do not annotate digital copies.

2. Stop highlighting text and underlining. Take notes. Do not colour in your photocopies.

3. Ensure that every module has a separate file. Insert notes from module readings on separate pages from the notes from lectures and seminars.

4. Ensure than an accurate reference is logged. This will save time later.

5. Either type or write your notes. Ensure they are legible for future use.

6. Write down the key argument of the writer/s in one sentence.

7. Look at the bibliography/reference list used by the writer, noting the quality and dates of the cited scholarship.

8. Copy important quotations accurately. Carefully differentiate between your notes, the paraphrasing of the author, and direct quotations.

9. Ensure that your notes are sufficiently detailed so that you do not need to return to the original text when writing an assignment.

10. Ensure that your notes are sufficiently brief that you have not paraphrased the entire article.
